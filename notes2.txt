looks good, still needs a bit of norming + solo philo func

getting issues of "lock acquisition order" still ? unsure what those are or how what order is being referred to, will check that out later.

i cannot write proper conditions apparently lol
anyway fixed

also (obviously), needs more rigorous testing

looking good so far, will check back in later to ensure proper functionality
next up : parsing (boooo)
